# python-SplitString

```py
print(_("Your String"))
```

A dictionary with the following keys is passed as output: `_`, `check`, `choice`, `len`. <br/>
`_` - A list is stored here, which contains almost equal parts of the passed string. <br/>
`check` - This key is passed only if the main function returned the value '0'. <br/>
`choice` - A list is passed to this key, with values that serve as divisors of the passed string. <br/>
`len` - The size(number of characters) of the transmitted string is passed here. <br/>
